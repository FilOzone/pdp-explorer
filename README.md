The mockup file is created using Excalidraw. You can find it [here](https://github.com/FilOzone/pdp-explorer/blob/main/assets/pdp-explorer-mockups.excalidraw).

# Usage

A few user journeys:
As a user storing data with PDP I can use the explorer to:

- Check if my SP has had any faults. And I can check which data in particular was faulted
- Validate that all of the data added to my proofset is data that I asked to store, not anything else
- Look at fault rate of SPs in the network when deciding who to store my data with
- Learn about data that has been removed from my proofset
