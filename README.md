Data model and UI for exploring the PDP hot storage network

# Mockup 

This is a first draft at what the PDP explorer will look like ![pdpexplorer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0595422-fa77-490b-ab57-0c9516ea5d8a)

The mockup file is created using Excalidraw. You can find it [here](https://github.com/FilOzone/pdp-explorer/blob/main/assets/pdp-explorer-mockups.excalidraw).

# Usage

A few user journeys: 
As a user storing data with PDP I can use the explorer to: 
* Check if my SP has had any faults.  And I can check which data in particular was faulted
* Validate that all of the data added to my proofset is data that I asked to store, not anything else
* Look at fault rate of SPs in the network when deciding who to store my data with
* Learn about data that has been removed from my proofset
